# CLAUDE.md — dc-plugins marketplace

This repo is a **Claude Code plugin marketplace** (`datacraftdevelopment/dc-plugins`). One `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` lists every plugin; each plugin is a self-contained subfolder with its own `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`. Installed once per machine (`/plugin marketplace add datacraftdevelopment/dc-plugins`), then plugins are installed individually.

Current plugins: **`pm`** (project-management scaffold + session/delivery skills) and **`fm-dc`** (agentic FileMaker development).

## ⚠️ Pre-flight: adding or copying a plugin/skill INTO this repo

These plugins are **shared across machines via git**. A file that works locally can silently break on another machine. Before adding a plugin or skill — and before claiming it works — run every check below. Each one is a gotcha we have actually hit.

1. **Symlinks — the #1 gotcha.** `cp -R` copies a symlink as a link, not its target, so anything symlinked out (e.g. a skill kept in iCloud/Obsidian and linked into `~/.claude/skills/`) ships as a dangling reference that won't resolve on install.
   ```bash
   git -C <source> ls-files -s | awk '$1=="120000"'      # any output = a committed symlink
   find <source-dir> -type l                              # untracked symlinks
   ```
   Fix: dereference into real files — `cp -RL`, or `rm link && cp -R <resolved-target> <dest>`.

2. **Copy git-tracked files ONLY.** A raw `cp -R` drags in `.venv/`, `sandbox/`, `__pycache__/`, `.pytest_cache/`, `.DS_Store`, and possibly **client data**. Copy the committed set instead:
   ```bash
   git -C <source> archive HEAD | tar -x -C <dest>
   ```
   Then confirm none of those dirs landed in `<dest>`.

3. **No machine-specific absolute paths** in shipped files:
   ```bash
   git -C <source> grep -n "/Users/" -- '*.md' '*.py' '*.json' '*.txt'
   ```
   Rewrite install/usage docs to the marketplace form (`/plugin install <name>`), not `claude --plugin-dir /Users/...`. (Provenance notes in `VENDOR.md` are fine.)

4. **Tool invocation must be portable.** Scripts must be called via `python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/…` (or the equivalent root var), never a hardcoded `.venv/bin/python` — the venv does not travel. Runtime deps go into **system `python3`** per machine; document them (fm-dc: `pip3 install lxml requests python-dotenv`).

5. **No name collisions** across plugins — commands, skills, and agents share their namespaces:
   ```bash
   ls */commands */skills */agents 2>/dev/null   # eyeball for dupes across plugins
   ```

6. **Validate every manifest is real JSON:**
   ```bash
   python3 -c "import json,glob; [json.load(open(f)) for f in glob.glob('**/.claude-plugin/*.json', recursive=True)]; print('OK')"
   ```

7. **Test from the NEW location, not the source.** If the plugin has a suite, run it here after the move — parity is the only proof the copy is complete (fm-dc: `cd fm-dc && .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests -q`).

8. **Bump the plugin's `version`** in its `plugin.json` on any shipped change, so `/plugin marketplace update` actually pulls it.

## Renaming a plugin — watch for name-shaped strings that aren't the name

A plugin's name drives its command namespace (`/<plugin>:<command>`), but the same token often appears as **config filenames or cache paths hardcoded in code** (e.g. fm-dc reads `fm-dc.json` and writes `~/.fm-dc/`). Those are NOT the plugin name — a blind find-replace breaks the tools. Change the namespace refs; leave the hardcoded data paths.

## Dev workflow

Develop **in place** in each plugin's subfolder — this repo is the single source of truth (standalone plugin repos were retired). Ship a change: commit + push, then `/plugin marketplace update dc-plugins` on each machine. Add a new plugin: new subfolder + one line in `marketplace.json` — never a new marketplace.

**One exception:** `pm/template/` mirrors the external **DC-Project-Builder** repo (`datacraftdevelopment/dc-project-builder`, in `DC_Code-2026/_Builders/`) — the PM scaffold's design home, whose `docs/_design/` history names client paths and must never ship here (scrubbed once already, pm v0.2.2). Scaffold changes land in the builder first, then get mirrored into `pm/template/` + version-bumped. Only the template's `CLAUDE.md` and `README.md` intentionally differ (stamped-project voice; no `docs/_design/`; no local `.claude/skills/` — the builder's local skill copies are its own working versions and may deliberately diverge from `pm/skills/`). Verify a sync with `diff -rq`.

Per-plugin dev cruft (`.venv/`, `sandbox/`) is gitignored via each plugin's own nested `.gitignore`, so it never publishes.

## Tracking (`_pm/`, local-only)

Root `_pm/` holds personal dev tracking (skeleton, TASKS, sessions) via the `pm` plugin's `whats-next` / `stepping-away` skills. It is **gitignored** (`/_pm/`, anchored so it doesn't touch `pm/template/_pm/`) — never published. Because this repo lives in Dropbox, `_pm/` still syncs across machines outside of git.
