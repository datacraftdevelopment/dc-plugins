name: verify-before-done
description: Evidence before claims — run the actual verification and read its output before saying anything is done, fixed, passing, or working. Use whenever about to claim completion or success in any form: "done", "fixed", "that should work now", "tests pass", marking a task completed, writing a checkpoint or stepping-away entry, or committing. Also use when the user asks "is it working?" or "did that fix it?". The claim and its evidence travel together or the claim doesn't ship.

# Verify Before Done

A false "done" costs more than a slow one: the user builds on work that isn't there, and discovering the gap later costs the trust that makes delegation work at all. The fix is mechanical, not moral — never claim what wasn't verified against the *current* state of the work.

## The rule

Before any completion claim, in order:

1. **Name the verification.** What command or check would prove this claim to a skeptic? Tests, build, lint, running the thing, loading the page, calling the endpoint — the check that would catch the failure you'd most plausibly have caused.
2. **Run it fresh** — *after* the last change. A green run from before the latest edit proves nothing about the current state; edits invalidate old evidence, however recent.
3. **Read the output.** Actually read it — exit codes lie by omission (warnings, skipped tests, partial suites). The claim you're allowed to make is exactly what the output supports, no more.
4. **Report claim + evidence together.** "Done — `pytest` 14/14 green, and the new endpoint returns the payload in a manual curl." Not "done, should be good."

## When verification fails or doesn't exist

- **Red result → report it verbatim**, with the output. Never smooth a failure into "mostly working" — a named failure is useful; a hidden one is a trap.
- **Partially done → say which parts.** "The parser works (test output attached); the CLI flag isn't wired yet" beats a rounded-up "done".
- **Nothing runnable proves it** (prose, config for a system you can't reach, a design doc)? Say what *would* verify it and that it wasn't run — "this deploys correctly" becomes "the config matches the docs; I couldn't exercise a real deploy from here." Unverifiable-but-labeled keeps trust; unverifiable-but-confident spends it.

## The excuses, named

| The thought | The reality |
|---|---|
| "Tests passed earlier" | Earlier isn't now. The last edit is exactly the one that breaks things. |
| "The change is too simple to break anything" | Simple changes cause outsized breakage *because* nobody checks them. |
| "It should work" | "Should" is a prediction, not a verification. Run it or say it's a prediction. |
| "Running the suite takes too long" | Then run the relevant subset and say that's what you ran. Scope the claim to the evidence. |

## Where it lands in the pm flow

`checkpoint` and `stepping-away` entries record what shipped — a "shipped" line in a session entry is a completion claim and carries evidence like any other. Tasks move to completed only on verified work; blocked or partial stays honestly in progress with the failure named.
